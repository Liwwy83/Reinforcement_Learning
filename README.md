# Reinforcement_Learning
For exploring RL.

My first toy environment is a single Knight piece on a chess board (8x8 squares).
In Version 1, I set the objective as getting the Knight to a corner square on the board with the minimum number of moves.
In Version 2, I changed the target to a particular square on the chess board.

The python notebook shows how reinforcement learning is used with Bellman's equations to arrive at the optimal policy.

In Version 1, the Knight can always reach a corner square within 3 moves no matter which square it starts from.
In Version 2, that changed to 4 moves.
